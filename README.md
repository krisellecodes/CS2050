# CS2050

Course materials for MSU CS 2050 - Computer Science 2

The Python files/modules that we have created and will be using later on in the semester are below. 
Be sure that using any of these in another Python program that you place them in same directory as one another. 
For example, when using stack.py in another Python program, then stack.py and your_new_program.py should be in the same directory. 

__NOTE__: All of the following files have some unit tests that fail, either because the test set up needs to be fixed, or because there is a bug in a class/function implementation. The reason for this is to offer some __extra coding practice__. By reading and fixing these flaws you will gain additional practice coding, and can increase your understanding of how the data structures/algorithms we are studying behave. Although this is ungraded, it  it is recommended that you download these files and modify/fix each of them until all of the unit tests pass. Without a doubt, this will help you to succeed in the course. 

### Core classes (we will be using these again!)
* stack.py - a basic stack class with push and pop operations
* queue.py - a queue class with enqueue and dequeue methods
* deque.py - a double-ended queue with addFront, addRear, removeFront, and removeRear methods
* lists.py - implementations of Node, UnorderedList, and OrderedList linked list classes 

### Additional classes/programs
* palchecker.py - check for palindromes
* anagram.py - four algorithms to check wehther a string is an anagram of another; NOTE: there are currently 4 bugs in this code (one in each algorithm)!
