# CS2050

Course materials for MSU CS 2050 - Computer Science 2

The Python files/modules that we have created and will be using later on in the semester are below. 
Be sure that using any of these in another Python program that you place them in same directory as one another. 
For example, when using stack.py in another Python program, then stack.py and your_new_program.py should be in the same directory. 

### Core classes (we will be using these again!)
* stack.py - a basic stack class with push and pop operations
* queue.py - a queue class with enqueue and dequeue methods
* deque.py - a double-ended queue with addFront, addRear, removeFront, and removeRear methods


### Additional classes/programs
* palchecker.py - check for palindromes
